stress
---

Lightweight compute resource stress utility. Originally forked from [vishh/stress](https://github.com/vishh/stress) and updated to work again.

You can pull a container image from the [GitHub Container Repo](https://github.com/HelixSpiral/stress/pkgs/container/stress)

Alternatively you can build this yourself for other architectures with `docker buildx build --platform=linux/amd64,linux/arm64 --push -t <imagename>:latest .`
